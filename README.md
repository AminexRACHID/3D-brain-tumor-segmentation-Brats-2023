## Description :

This project presents a 3D deep learning framework, utilizing advanced techniques like Swin Transformers, recurrent blocks, and attention mechanisms, designed for the automatic detection and segmentation of brain tumors from MRI scans. The framework, known as SAD-UNet, is developed to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability of brain tumor segmentation. It tackles the challenges of 3D MRI data processing and is evaluated on the BraTS 2023 dataset, demonstrating improvements in clinical decision-making for treatment planning and patient care.
